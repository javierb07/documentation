# Backtracking

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.
It solves problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point.

### Types of Backtracking Algorithm

- Decision Problem – search for a feasible solution.
- Optimization Problem – search for the best solution.
- Enumeration Problem – find all feasible solutions.
