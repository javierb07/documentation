# Tail Recursions

A special form of recursion where the last operation of a function is a recursive call. The recursion may be optimized away by executing the call in the current stack frame and returning its result rather than creating a new stack frame.

Tail recursion is defined as a recursive function in which the recursive call is the last statement that is executed by the function. So basically nothing is left to execute after the recursion call.

## Need for Tail Recursion

The tail recursive functions are considered better than non-tail recursive functions as tail-recursion can be optimized by the compiler. 

Compilers usually execute recursive procedures by using a stack. This stack consists of all the pertinent information, including the parameter values, for each recursive call. When a procedure is called, its information is pushed onto a stack, and when the function terminates the information is popped out of the stack. Thus for the non-tail-recursive functions, the stack depth (maximum amount of stack space used at any time during compilation) is more. 

The idea used by compilers to optimize tail-recursive functions is simple, since the recursive call is the last statement, there is nothing left to do in the current function, so saving the current functionâ€™s stack frame is of no use.

## Can a non-tail-recursive function be written as tail-recursive to optimize it?

Yes. Consider the following function to calculate the factorial of n. 

```python
def fact(n):
    if (n == 0):
        return 1
    return n * fact(n-1)
```

It is a non-tail-recursive function. We can see that the value returned by fact(n-1) is used in fact(n). So the call to fact(n-1) is not the last thing done by fact(n).

The above function can be written as a tail-recursive function. The idea is to use one more argument and accumulate the factorial value in the second argument. When n reaches 0, return the accumulated value.

Below is the implementation using a tail-recursive function.

```python
def fact(n, a=1):
 
    if (n <= 1):
        return a
 
    return fact(n - 1, n * a)
```
