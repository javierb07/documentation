# Null Object

A behavioral design pattern with no behaviors.
A no-op object that conforms to the required interface, satisfying a dependency requirement of some other object.

## Motivation

* When a component A uses component B, it typically assumes that B is non-null.
    * You inject B, not B? or some Option<B>.
    * You do not check for null (?.) on every call.
* There is no option of telling A *not* to use an instance of B.
    * Its use is hard-coded.
* Thus, we build a no-op, non-functioning inheritor of B and pass it into A./

## Summary

* Implement the required interface.
* Rewrite the methods with empty bodies.
    * If method is non-void, return default(T).
    * If these values are ever used, you are in trouble.
* Supply an instance of Null Object in place of actual object.
* Dynamic construction possible.
    * With associated performance implications.
