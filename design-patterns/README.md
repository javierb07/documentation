# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are optimized, reusable solutions to the programming problems that we encounter every day.
A design pattern is a description, or template, for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. It's not language-specific. A good design pattern should be implementable in most if not all languages, depending on the capabilities of the language. 

* Design patterns are common architectural approaches.
* Popularized by the Gang of Four book (1994) (Smalltalk & C++).
* Translated to many OOP (C#, Java, ...)
* Universally relevant, internalized in some programming languages and libraries.

There are three basic kinds of design patterns:

| Creational       | Structural  | Behavioral              |
| :----:           | :----:      | :----:                  |
| Builder          | Adapter     | Chain of Responsibility |
| Abstract Factory | Bridge      | Command                 |
| Factory Method   | Composite   | Interpreter             |
| Prototype        | Decorator   | Iterator                |
| Singleton        | Facade      | Mediator                |
| Object Pool      | Flyweight   | Memento                 |
|                  | Proxy       | Null Object             |
|                  |             | Observer                |
|                  |             | State                   |
|                  |             | Strategy                |
|                  |             | Template Method         |
|                  |             | Visitor                 |

Generally, the three groups above define how a program elements relate to each other, how they get created, and how they communicate with each other.
